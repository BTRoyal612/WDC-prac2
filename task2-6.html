        <h1>Check out my borders</h1>

        <p>We&quot;ve modified the content div to have a 1px darkgrey border with rounded corners of an 8px radius.</p>

        <p>
            Other elements can have borders too,
            <span class="red-border">like this span with the class red-border</span>.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            You can change the colr of horizontal rules by changing the border color;
            <br>all horizontal rules are now #CFDFE4.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alternately,
            <span class="red-outline">this span has a red outline (red-outline class).</span>
            <br>That prevents it from messing with the line height.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>Notice how the borders double up here:</p>

    <div class="red-border"><p>This div has a red border</p></div>

    <div class="blue-border"><p>This div has a blue border</p></div>

    <p>Notice how this fixed the borders:</p>

    <div class="red-border rounded-top"><p>This div has a red border expect on the bottom, and 8px round top corners</p></div>

    <div class="blue-border rounded-bottom"><p>This div has a blue border, and 8px round bottom corners</p></div>
</body>
