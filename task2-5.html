        <h1>A page with some divs and spans</h1>

        <p>This page looks much cleaner now that I&apos;ve put my content in a div with a white backgground.</p>

        <p>
            Because this div is special, it has it&apos;s own id, &quot;content&quot;.
            <br> This allows us to differentiate it from other divs and give it a white background.

        <p>
            This is a normal paragraph, except 
            <span class="blue">this span of text is blue</span>
            <span class="fancy">and this span has a font-family of cursive,</span>
            because they belong to two classes called &quot;blue&quot; and &quot;fancy&quot; respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
            On the other hand, 
            <span class="blue fancy">this span of text is both blue and fancy!</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div>
        <p>This text is inside a normal div, but the background has not been set.</p>
